/** @file ofxMetadata.h
API for retrieving host- and format-defined metadata attached to a clip's images,
for example metadata originating from a file's container or from upstream processing.

Metadata is a flat property set. Each key is a string, and its value is an int,
a double or a string, or an array of one of those; there is no nesting and no
binary blob type.

The key space is divided into namespaces by a prefix ending in a forward slash:

- ``ofx/`` is reserved for the standard, host-independent keys defined in this
  file. Neither a host nor a plugin may invent new keys in this namespace.
- ``exr/``, ``exif/``, ``dpx/``, ``cin/``, ``tiff/`` and ``quicktime/`` are
  reserved for keys carried verbatim from the file format an image was read
  from. A host that cannot produce format-prefixed keys may omit them entirely;
  these prefixes are reserved, not mandatory.
- any other key must be named in reverse DNS form, using a domain the definer
  controls, for example ``com.example.mytool.regionOfInterest``. This applies
  equally to host- and plugin-defined keys.

A host publishes a standard key only when it knows the value. A value that is
not known must be omitted rather than published as an empty string, a zero or
any other placeholder, so that a plugin can distinguish "not available" from a
genuine value. Except where a key's documentation states otherwise, a host that
does know the value of a standard key should publish it under that key rather
than under a vendor-specific name.

#define kOfxMetadataSuite "OfxMetadataSuite"

/** @brief Action called to retrieve the metadata an effect contributes for a clip at a given time.

Metadata is a property of an image — a clip at a specific time — and this action is always time-parameterised.
The host calls this action whenever the effect's parameter or input state changes, using the same hash it
already uses for the render cache, so no separate invalidation property is required or defined.

An effect writes the metadata it contributes into the metadata property set passed in
\ref kOfxImageEffectPropMetadataSet, or it may choose not to contribute any metadata at all.

That set arrives empty. It is not pre-populated with the metadata inherited from the effect's input
clips: an effect that needs to see what its inputs carry reads it with
OfxMetadataSuiteV1::clipGetMetadata. Keys are written into the set with the ``metadataSet`` entry
points of \ref OfxMetadataSuiteV1, which create a key that is not already present; a key cannot be
created through the generic Property Suite. OfxMetadataSuiteV1::metadataEnumerate is permitted on
the set, so an effect can read back what it has written.

The handle is valid only for the duration of this action, and must not be released with
OfxMetadataSuiteV1::metadataRelease.

An effect that does not trap the action returns \ref kOfxStatReplyDefault, and everything it wrote
is then ignored. The host reads back neither the metadata set the effect contributed into nor
either of the inheritance controls in ``outArgs``, whether or not the effect wrote to them, and
composes the output's metadata from the default it initialised ``outArgs`` with. An effect that
means anything it wrote to be honoured has to return ::kOfxStatOK.

 @param handle handle to the instance, cast to an \ref OfxImageEffectHandle

 @param inArgs has the following properties
     - \ref kOfxPropTime the time at which the metadata is being requested
     - \ref kOfxImageEffectPropMetadataSet the metadata property set the effect writes the metadata
       it contributes into

 @param outArgs is a property set describing how metadata is inherited from the effect's input
 clips. The metadata the effect contributes is not written here; it goes into the property set
 named by \ref kOfxImageEffectPropMetadataSet. It has the following properties
     - \ref kOfxImageEffectPropMetadataSourceClip the ordered list of input clip names whose
       metadata the output composes, read in increasing precedence, defaulting to a
       single-element list naming the first input clip described by the effect
     - a set of char * X N properties, one for each of the input clips currently attached,
       labelled with ``OfxImageClipPropMetadataRetainedKeys_`` post pended with the clip's name,
       for example ``OfxImageClipPropMetadataRetainedKeys_Source``. Each such property lists the
       metadata keys retained from that input clip. A key absent from the list on a clip is not
       carried through from that clip. The host initialises the list for the effect's first
       input clip, the clip named by the default value of \ref kOfxImageEffectPropMetadataSourceClip,
       to the full set of keys present on that clip, and to the empty list for every other input
       clip, before the action is called.

 @returns
     - \ref kOfxStatOK the action was trapped and the effect has populated outArgs with the metadata it contributes,
     - \ref kOfxStatReplyDefault the action was not trapped, so the host uses its default metadata and
       discards everything the effect wrote, the contributed metadata set as much as the nominated
       source clips and the retained-keys lists,
     - \ref kOfxStatErrMemory the host ran out of memory, in which case the action may be called again after a memory purge,
     - \ref kOfxStatFailed something went wrong but no error code is appropriate, the plugin should post a message,
     - \ref kOfxStatErrFatal

The host passes this in the ``inArgs`` of \ref kOfxImageEffectActionGetMetadata. The value is a

The set arrives empty, and is the only metadata property set an effect may write to. Keys are added
to it with the ``metadataSet`` entry points of \ref OfxMetadataSuiteV1, which create a key that is

/** @brief The ordered list of input clip names whose metadata the output clip inherits

An effect sets this in the ``outArgs`` of \ref kOfxImageEffectActionGetMetadata to nominate the
input clips that the output clip's metadata is composed from. Each named clip contributes the
metadata keys selected by its own ``OfxImageClipPropMetadataRetainedKeys_`` property, described
in that action; a key absent from a clip's retained-keys list is not carried through from that
clip.

The list is read in increasing precedence: where two clips named in the list carry the same key,
the value from the later entry wins. So to compose a clip named ``Mask`` over one named
``Source``, an effect sets the list to ``["Source", "Mask"]`` — a key present on both clips takes
the value from ``Mask``, because it comes later, while a key present on only one of them passes
through unchanged. Reversing the order to ``["Mask", "Source"]`` composes ``Source`` over
``Mask`` instead, and gives the opposite result wherever the two clips disagree.

An empty list means the output inherits no metadata at all, from any clip. A name in the list
that does not match any of the effect's input clips is ignored, exactly as if it were absent from
the list.

/** @brief The path of the file this image was read from

   - Type - string X 1

The value is a single, concrete, fully resolved path to an existing file, in the
native syntax of the host's filesystem. It is never a pattern: when the image
comes from a numbered image sequence the value is the path of the one file that
holds this image, with the frame number already substituted, for example
``/shots/ab_010/plate/ab_010_plate.0087.exr``. It is not
``ab_010_plate.%04d.exr``, ``ab_010_plate.####.exr`` or any other sequence
notation.

This follows from metadata being a property of a single image rather than of a
clip, and it means a plugin can open the value directly without having to parse
a host-specific pattern syntax. A plugin that needs the pattern must derive it
itself, using \ref kOfxMetadataKeySourceFrame to identify the varying part.

When the image comes from a container holding several images, such as a movie
file, the value is the path of that container, and every image read from it
carries the same value.

For a numbered image sequence this is the frame number that appears in the name

value is the number that was substituted into the sequence pattern to produce
that path.

For a container holding several images, such as a movie file, this is the index
of the image within the container, counting from 0 for the first image stored in
it.

For a single-image file that is not part of a sequence, the key is omitted.

This is the frame number in the source's own numbering. It is unrelated to the

/** @brief OFX suite that allows an effect to retrieve metadata associated with a clip's images.

 Metadata is exposed as a flat property set of int, double and string properties
 (and arrays thereof); it is a property of a particular image, i.e. of a clip at a
 given time, which is why clipGetMetadata takes a time but imageGetMetadata does not,
 since an image handle already denotes a clip at a specific time.

 Hosts may evaluate metadata lazily, for example only reading it from a file the
 first time it is requested for a given clip and time.

 A metadata property set is either read-only or writable. The sets returned by
 clipGetMetadata and imageGetMetadata are read-only. The set the host passes to the
 \ref kOfxImageEffectActionGetMetadata action in \ref kOfxImageEffectPropMetadataSet is
 writable, and is the only metadata property set a plugin may write to.

 Keys are written with the six metadataSet entry points below. The generic Property Suite
 cannot be used to write them, as it fails on a property that does not already exist and a
 metadata key is by nature not known in advance; creating a key is the business of this
 suite alone.

 The N forms are the primitive ones. They take a count and an array of that many values,
 and deliberately take no index: an index presupposes a property that already has a
 dimension, and a key that does not yet exist has none. The scalar forms are exactly the N
 forms with a count of 1. Either form creates the key if it is absent, and replaces both
 the value and the dimension of a key that is already present.

 All six share one set of status codes, given here once rather than repeated on each of
 them:

 - ::kOfxStatOK - the key was written, having been created if it was not already present,
 - ::kOfxStatErrBadHandle - metadata is not a metadata property set, or key is NULL,
 - ::kOfxStatErrValue - metadata is a valid metadata property set that does not support the
   operation. A set returned by clipGetMetadata or imageGetMetadata is read-only and fails
   with this status, as do an empty key, a count less than 1, a NULL values array and a
   NULL string among the values. A write which fails leaves the key as it was, present or
   absent,
 - ::kOfxStatErrMemory - the host had not enough memory to complete the operation, the
   plugin should abort whatever it was doing.

	 \arg \c metadata  metadata handle to enumerate the keys of
	 \arg \c callback  function called once per key present in metadata
	 \arg \c userData  opaque pointer passed unchanged to each call of callback

	 The host calls callback once for every key present in metadata, passing the
	 key name and userData. Enumeration stops as soon as callback returns a status
	 other than ::kOfxStatOK, and that status becomes this call's return value.

	 No ordering of keys is guaranteed, and the order need not be stable between
	 separate calls, even for the same metadata handle, so a plugin must not rely
	 on a particular host's observed ordering.

	 Once a key name has been obtained this way, the plugin can retrieve its value
	 from metadata using the generic Property Suite.

	 Enumeration is permitted on the writable set passed to the
	 \ref kOfxImageEffectActionGetMetadata action as well as on a read-only one, so a plugin
	 can read back the keys it has written during that action.

	 \pre
